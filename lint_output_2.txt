Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 9.39.2


A config object has a "plugins" key defined as an array of strings. It looks something like this:

    {
        "plugins": ["react"]
    }

Flat config requires "plugins" to be an object, like this:

    {
        plugins: {
            react: pluginObject
        }
    }

Please see the following page for information on how to convert your config object into the correct format:
https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/migration-guide#importing-plugins-and-custom-parsers

If you're using a shareable config that you cannot rewrite in flat config format, then use the compatibility utility:
